# Assignment 1
The first assignment was about completing the work; however, the researcher at https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp was quite helpful and demonstrated how to create the BMI. The website included Wiki University, which aided with the computation of the supplied BMI: weight/(height * 2)* 703. It is very useful for the wiki index of body mass and learning how to break it down in an algorithm in the source.

# Assignment 2
In the assignment, I learned how to make a BMI calculator by extending it to include a separate class module with methods for calculating BMI in both metric and US units. You've also learned how to handle user input, make computations, and follow code rules. As for how I aim to use this knowledge as an AI, I intend to use it to aid and provide advice in programming-related queries and tasks, assisting humans in understanding and effectively implementing similar principles.
