# Assignment 1
The first assignment was about completing the work; however, the researcher at https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp was quite helpful and demonstrated how to create the BMI. The website included Wiki University, which aided with the computation of the supplied BMI: weight/(height * 2)* 703. It is very useful for the wiki index of body mass and learning how to break it down in an algorithm in the source.

# Assignment 2
I have defined the variables height_inches, height_feet, and weight_pounds with initial values. These represent the user's height in inches and feet and their weight in pounds, respectively. The get_user_height function takes height_feet and height_inches as parameters and calculates the total height in inches by converting the feet to inches and adding the remaining inches. The calculate_user_bmi function takes weight, pounds, and height as parameters. It calculates the BMI using the formula (weight_pounds / (height ** 2)) * 703. The formula adjusts for the fact that BMI is typically measured in metric units, so it multiplies the result by 703 to convert from metric to imperial units. The main function is the central part of your program. It prompts the user to input their weight in pounds, height in feet, and height in inches using the input function and then converts the inputs to floating-point numbers. The program then calls the get_user_height function to calculate the total height in inches. After that, it calls the calculate_user_bmi function with the user's weight in pounds and calculated height. Finally, it prints out the calculated BMI. The if __name__ == __main__ condition ensures that the main function is executed only if the script is run directly.

# Asssignment 3
The Python script calculates a user's body mass index (BMI) based on their weight in pounds and height in feet and inches. The code starts by defining some constants. height_inches The user's height in inches (initially set to 12). height_feet The user's height in feet (initially set to 1). weight_pounds The user's weight in pounds (initially set to 0.453592, which appears to be a conversion factor from pounds to kilograms). The code defines three functions. get_user_height(height_feet, height_inches) This function takes the user's height in feet and inches as arguments and returns the total height in inches by converting feet to inches and adding the remaining inches. calculate_user_bmi(weight_pounds, height) This function calculates the user's BMI using the formula (weight_pounds / (height ** 2)) * 703, where height is the height in inches. get_user_bmi_classification(BMI) This function takes the calculated BMI as an argument and prints a classification message based on the BMI range. The main() function is defined as It starts by taking user input for weight in pounds, height in feet, and height in inches. It calculates the total height in inches using the get_user_height() function. It calculates the BMI using the calculate_user_bmi() function. It prints the calculated BMI. It determines the user's BMI classification using the get_user_bmi_classification() function and prints the corresponding classification message. Finally, the script checks if the script is being run directly (as opposed to being imported as a module) using the if __name__ == "__main__": condition. If the condition is met, the main() function is executed. When I run this script, it will prompt you to enter your weight in pounds, your height in feet, and your height in inches. Then it will calculate your BMI, display it, and provide a classification message based on the BMI range.

# Assignment 4
The Python program that I built calculates a user's BMI (body mass index) based on their weight in pounds and height in feet and inches. The application also divides BMI into groups like very underweight, underweight, healthy weight, overweight, and obese. I've defined constants for the user's height in inches (height_inches), height in feet (height_feet), and the pound-to-kilogram conversion factor (weight_pounds). The get_user_height function takes height_feet and height_inches as arguments and uses a while loop to determine the total height in inches. The calculate_user_bmi function computes the BMI based on the user's weight in pounds and height. It uses the BMI formula to calculate the result and transforms it into a BMI number. Similarly, any value error is detected and an error message is displayed. The get_user_bmi_classification function accepts the calculated BMI as input and categorizes it based on the supplied BMI ranges. The main function is where the program begins to run. It requests the user's weight in pounds, height in feet, and height in inches. The total height and BMI are then calculated using the functions you defined before.  It outputs the estimated BMI and then calls the get_user_bmi_classification function to obtain the classification. You did, however, forget to publish the classification notice. Finally, the if __name__ == "__main__": block guarantees that the main function is called when the script is run directly (rather than being imported as a module). Overall, my program is intended to compute and categorize a user's BMI based on their inputs. However, in the main function, I may want to add a print statement to display the BMI categorization, and you may want to consider enhancing the error handling to provide more useful error messages.

# Assignment 5
I need to write a test for this assignment, and it's important to note that the test cases test_invalid_get_user_height and test_invalid_calculate_user_bmi appear to be looking for instances where invalid data might occur. Negative height and weight values are not usually accepted as inputs for BMI calculations. The test cases determine if the code smoothly accepts such invalid inputs and achieves the desired outputs. I ensure that the assignment_5 module contains the BMI class along with the necessary methods and properties for these test cases to function properly. When you run this test suite, it will run these test cases and indicate whether or not they pass.

# Assignment 6
I learned about how to build up classes for several categories of employees in this assignment: supervisors, salespeople, and hourly employees. These classes all derive from the Employee base class. Each sort of employee has unique characteristics and compensation calculation procedures. This code also taught me how to use it to learn new things about technology. Understanding these concepts and strategies will be useful while I work on this assignment because I will be working in a technology-driven atmosphere. Furthermore, learning to read and interpret code in this manner will allow me to engage with developers and technical teams in my line of work, allowing me to be a more versatile and effective team member.

# Assignment 7 
This assignment provided me with valuable insights into the concept of polymorphism and its practical application in object-oriented programming using Python. Polymorphism stands as a foundational concept in the world of object-oriented programming, enabling objects from diverse classes to be treated as instances of a shared base class. By abstracting away the specific implementation details and concentrating on the common behaviors shared by objects, polymorphism equips developers with the ability to craft more adaptable and reusable code. Polymorphism, as a powerful paradigm within object-oriented programming, champions code reusability, maintainability, and adaptability. It simplifies the management of intricate systems by enabling interactions with various objects through a unified interface. This, in turn, enhances the elegance and scalability of one's codebase, making it more amenable to future development and expansion. Although computer science is not my primary field of expertise, delving into this assignment has proven to be an engaging and enlightening experience. It has opened my eyes to the intriguing world of coding at this level, and I'm eager to continue learning and exploring these concepts further.

# Assignment 8
The assignment of creating a video game to promote go-fishing I learned how to make a graphical user interface (GUI) application in Python using the Tkinter framework. I included the Tkinter library, which is a typical Python framework for building graphical user interfaces. To act as the main application for your Go Fish card game, I designed a class called CardGameApp. You used Tkinter widgets to construct the GUI layout in the CardGameApp class. Labels, buttons, and other items are used in this layout to indicate player hands, game controllers, and game status. To display information and interact with the game, I developed several Tkinter components such as labels, buttons, and other widgets. Within the CardGameApp class, I created the game logic to handle operations like drawing cards, checking for game rules, and modifying the GUI based on game state. To display player hands, game state, and other information, I utilized Tkinter labels. As the game state changed, these labels were dynamically modified. To activate game events, I linked button actions (for example, drawing cards) to specific methods in your CardGameApp class. I started the Tkinter main event loop with root.mainloop(), which keeps your GUI program responsive to user inputs. I acquired expertise in constructing a simple GUI interface, integrating it into your game logic, and handling user interactions by making this Go Fish game with a GUI. In the future, I can build on this base to construct more complex card games or other GUI apps.

# Assignment 9
The assignment I learned about is project planning for the "Online Learning Platform Enhancement Project." I learned that clear objectives, a well-defined scope, and active stakeholder involvement are essential for a successful project. These elements help ensure project goals are understood, boundaries are defined, and expectations are managed, ultimately contributing to successful project execution and delivery.
