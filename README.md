# Assignment 1
#The first assignment was about how to complete the task, but the researcher at https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp was really helpful and showed me how to design the BMI. There are many other websites where I utilize the same categories chart and add small ticks instead of decimals. Calculate the given BMI as well: weight/(height * 2)* 703. It helps a lot in the wiki index of body mass and learning how to break it down in an algorithm in the source that delivers inÂ martial arts, but finding the information is like a treasure hunt.
