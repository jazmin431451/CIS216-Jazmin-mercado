# Assignment 1
The first assignment was about completing the work; however, the researcher at https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp was quite helpful and demonstrated how to create the BMI. The website included Wiki University, which aided with the computation of the supplied BMI: weight/(height * 2)* 703. It is very useful for the wiki index of body mass and learning how to break it down in an algorithm in the source.

# Assignment 2
I have defined the variables height_inches, height_feet, and weight_pounds with initial values. These represent the user's height in inches and feet and their weight in pounds, respectively. The get_user_height function takes height_feet and height_inches as parameters and calculates the total height in inches by converting the feet to inches and adding the remaining inches. The calculate_user_bmi function takes weight, pounds, and height as parameters. It calculates the BMI using the formula (weight_pounds / (height ** 2)) * 703. The formula adjusts for the fact that BMI is typically measured in metric units, so it multiplies the result by 703 to convert from metric to imperial units. The main function is the central part of your program. It prompts the user to input their weight in pounds, height in feet, and height in inches using the input function and then converts the inputs to floating-point numbers. The program then calls the get_user_height function to calculate the total height in inches. After that, it calls the calculate_user_bmi function with the user's weight in pounds and calculated height. Finally, it prints out the calculated BMI. The if __name__ == __main__ condition ensures that the main function is executed only if the script is run directly.
